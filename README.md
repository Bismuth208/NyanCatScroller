# Nyan Scroller
![Magic ](img/nyan_pic.png "Magic")
***

Just more ore less modern port of of my old old code.
It should work pretty much on any MCU, but require a few GPIO tweaks inside "pins.h".

Works with SSD1306 oled screens.
Tested under ESP32.

Also require to install Arduino libraries:
 - Adafruit_SSD1306
 - Adafruit-GFX-Library
 - Adafruit_BusIO
